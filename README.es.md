Create a TODO list application that allows users to add and delete tasks from the command line.



## üìù Instructions

These are the functions you will have to implement:

```python
def add_one_task(title):
def print_list():
def delete_task(number_to_delete):
def save_todos():
def load_todos():
```

- Your app must work from the command line [like this](https://4geeks.com/interactive-coding-tutorial/beginner/todo-list-cli-python).
- The user should be able to add new tasks
- The user can add as many tasks as he want.
- The user can delete tasks by specifying the task position in the list.
- The user can save the todos to a `todos.csv` file
- The user can retrieve the todos from a `todos.csv` file
- There is no way to update a task; the user must delete and create it again.
